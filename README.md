Jquery Event Planner
In this javascript/Jquery project I am creating a daily planner that will update me in realtime on the exact day and time. 
My planner will also provide a color coated schedule for each hour of the day. 
When an event/hour has passed, that hourly block of the planner will be greyed out. 
When it is the current time of the event/hour, that hourly block will be red indicating that the hour is in progress.
For future blocks of time, each block will be color coded green.
If I want to save something in my planner for an hourly block, I am able to input it in the text area and then click the lock button on the right to store/save that information.
If time has passed, I can delete any lines in the text area and then click the lock button again to save the removal.
